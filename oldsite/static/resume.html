					A stream of gobs is self-describing. Each data item in the stream is preceded by
					a specification of its type, expressed in terms of a small set of predefined
					types. Pointers are not transmitted, but the things they point to are
					transmitted; that is, the values are flattened. Nil pointers are not permitted,
					as they have no value. Recursive types work fine, but
					recursive values (data with cycles) are problematic. This may change.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use gobs, create an Encoder and present it with a series of data items as
					values or addresses that can be dereferenced to values. The Encoder makes sure
					all type information is sent before it is needed. At the receive side, a
					Decoder retrieves values from the encoded stream and unpacks them into local
					variables.
				</p>
				<h3 id="hdr-Types_and_Values">Types and Values</h3>
				<p>
					The source and destination values/types need not correspond exactly. For structs,
					fields (identified by name) that are in the source but absent from the receiving
					variable will be ignored. Fields that are in the receiving variable but missing
					from the transmitted type or value will be ignored in the destination. If a field
					with the same name is present in both, their types must be compatible. Both the
					receiver and transmitter will do all necessary indirection and dereferencing to
					convert between gobs and actual Go values. For instance, a gob type that is
					schematically,
